" Standard modifier key for VIM
"
" It must come at the begin in order to following remaps to work
"
" The choice of the space key was made by marcheing:
"
" Using space as the leader key to be able to add as many nnoremaps with
" arbitrary keys as I want without having to think about vim's default key
" uses. All I have to do is <Leader>.
" Actually, I like to change between the classical '\' and space because I'm
" still not sure of which one is the best. For now, I like space because it
" makes a sound when I'm using it, and I like to believe it is the sound of
" progress, instead of the sound of my keyboard dying and my colleagues being
" annoyed.
